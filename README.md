# AudioManipulation
## Project Description

A coursework project to complete some of the audio effects of our Professor. He provided a set of functions which he wanted to be created, and we were to find an approrpaite implementation, given his instructions as a guide. First we had to work out the math involved and then the code for the app.
My first commit was already worked on a bit before being committed to the repository.
